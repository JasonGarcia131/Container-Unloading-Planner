# About Container-Unloading-Planner
  This app makes unloading a shipping container much easier by taking the box dimensions from user input and creating a floor plan on how to stack the boxes by rows
  and columns. At the current company I work for, warehouse space was always an issue. Unloading containers required reviewing a packinglist that listed the incoming     box dimensions and SKU'S. Pre-planning how the boxes will be stacked and how much space was going to be occupied was tedious. This app does all the calculations and   can be downloaded into and excel spreadsheet.
